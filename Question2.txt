The table having a composite key (BranchID, OwnerID). Branch details depend on BranchID, owner details depend on OwnerID, and BranchType is transitively dependent, so the table is not in 3NF. We decompose it into Branch(BranchID PK, BranchName, BranchTypeID FK), BranchType(BranchTypeID PK, BranchTypeName), Owner(OwnerID PK, OwnerName, OwnerEmail), and BranchOwner(BranchID PK/FK, OwnerID PK/FK).
